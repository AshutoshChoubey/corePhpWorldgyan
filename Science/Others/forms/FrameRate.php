            <li class="PointTutorials"> <b>The limit of human perception:</b> There is no reason to show more frames per second than the audience experience. True extent of humans
                   The perception of movement is still pending scientific debate, but in general it is accepted that the upper limit is beyond which people can not
                   Appreciate the difference
             </li>
             <li class="PointTutorials"><b>Media cost and size:</b> The cost of film and video tape shares Higher frame rate requires more footage and more
                  Editing and media management becomes more difficult due to the increase in the amount of expensive raw media to shoot.

            <li class="PointTutorials" >
             The higher the frame rate, the more temporary (temporary) resolution of your footage, which means it may be slow to show details
                 The moment that otherwise becomes blurred, shooting at a high frame rate requires even more light, because the exposure time is less

              </li>
            <li class="PointTutorials">Slow frame rates are used for time-lapse photography, in which a scene is recorded relatively slowly, perhaps one frame every second, hour, or day. </li>
            <p class="h3">Examples of How Different Frame Rates Are Used</p>
            

<br /><b>The film is especially flexible in which this photograph can shoot and can be reproduced with a wide range of movement.</b>

     <li class="PointTutorials"> 1 frame per hour: Extreme time-lapse photography.</li>
     <li class="PointTutorials"> 1 frame per minute: Time-lapse photography and stop-motion animation.</li>
     <li class="PointTutorials"> 18 frames per second: Early motion picture films.</li>
     <li class="PointTutorials">24 frames per second: Worldwide standard for movie theater film projectors.</li>
     <li class="PointTutorials"> 48 frames per second: Slow-motion photography (because it takes twice as long to play back in a 24 fps projector, the motion is twice as slow).</li>
     <li class="PointTutorials"> 300+ frames per second: High-speed cameras for very slow-motion photography (often used for miniatures to make models seem larger on screen).</li>
     <li class="PointTutorials"> 2500+ frames per second: Very high-speed cameras for special effects such as pyrotechnic photography and explosions.</li>
